Hello, that's a simple Python alogithm to compare two files and see if they are different. \***\*
You gonna need to add the two files in the same folder with the `valida_file,.py` \*\***
When you execute the `valida_file.py` they gonna ask to you insert the Path of the files, so all you need to do is put the name and extension on two files and the script gonna run and return if the files are equal or not. \*\*\*\*
That's it, good bye!
